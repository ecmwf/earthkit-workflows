"""Entrypoint for running the benchmark suite

Example:
```
python -m cascade.benchmarks --job j1.prob --executor fiab --dynamic True --workers 2 --fusing False
```

Make sure you correctly configure:
 - LD_LIBRARY_PATH (a few lines below, in this mod)
 - JOB1_{...} as noted in benchmarks.job1 (presumably run `download_*` from job1 first)
 - your venv (cascade, fiab, pproc-cascade, compatible version of earthkit-data, ...)
